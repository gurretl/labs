Title: FROM THE SIMME VALLEY TO LAKE THUN
Description: This hike is ideal for warm weather. The route runs along the Simme, most of the time under a shady roof of leaves. If you wish, you can even treat yourself to a foot bath in different places to cool off. And on arrival, it is also possible to swim in Lake Thun. The hike starts in Oey and runs along the bank of the Simme in a charming landscape to the Simmenporte dam. When the flow of the river is high, the water rushes into the void over the dam with a deafening noise. After a short ride along the main road and under the motorway bridge, you arrive near Wimmis at the Herrenmätteli home, where a large playground invites you to relax and have a picnic. Another highlight is crossing the longest cantilever wooden bridge in Switzerland, built for cyclists and pedestrians. After the bridge, the path goes back down towards the Simme, which flows into the Kander here. The final stage of the hike leads away from the water at Hani and up a faint hill with magnificent views of Lake Thun. The hike ends at Gwatt. Bonstetten Park offers ideal swimming opportunities if you still want to cool off.
Oey-Diemtigen is reached by train from Bern or Zweisimmen. From the “Gwatt, Moos” stop, the bus travels to Thun or Spiez. 
Distance: 11.61km 
Elevation: 170m

Title: BETWEEN AGITATION AND CALM AT THE COL DU GRIMSEL
Description: There is currently great turmoil in the Grimsel nature reserve. Heavy trucks transport construction materials, motorcycles roar around the bends. Below the Räterichsbodensee dam, excavators and conveyors are at work, sorting the gravel by size. Higher up, at the Spitallamm dam, two enormous construction cranes pour concrete into a formwork all day long. The hike from Handegg to the Grimsel Pass is not very idyllic at the moment. It nevertheless reserves some surprises and is a remarkable reminder of the subjects which are of great concern to humanity at the moment: protection of nature, energy and transport. All this takes place in a magnificent alpine landscape and, during the hike, one also regularly finds quiet and secluded corners. From Handegg, the path climbs gently over scree and through sparse forest to the first stone arch bridge. It then crosses the still small Aare a second time, before climbing to reach Lake Räterichsbodensee. Together with the Gelmer, Grimsel, Oberaar and Totesee lakes, it has provided water for valuable electricity production for decades, both in summer and winter. We sometimes hear calls from climbers scaling the granite slopes polished by the glacier. Another climb leads to Lake Grimsel, where a hospice sits on the majestic Spittelnollen. A new dam will be built by 2025 directly in front of the current wall, because a renovation would have been too expensive. The hiking trail continues between the lake and the pass road before reaching, in a few bends, the watershed at the Grimsel Pass, at an altitude of 2,164 meters. At this location, the rain decides whether it will flow into the Mediterranean Sea or the North Sea.
“Handegg, Gelmerbahn” can be reached by post bus from Innertkirchen, Gletsch or Oberwald. The return is on the same line from the Grimsel pass.
Distance: 9.64km
Elevation: 937m

Title: VIEW AT THE SUMMIT IN THE DIEMTIGTAL
Description: “first category observation point”: there are many mountains which, in the hearts of hikers and on social networks, compete for the gold medal for the best place to admire the surrounding landscape. Since there is no perfectly objective criterion for selecting the most attractive peak in a region, why not choose the highest? With its 2,652 meters, the Männliflue dominates the Diemtigtal nature park in the canton of Bern. But be careful, to enjoy this sumptuous panorama, you need to have your calves in good shape: the route linking Achseten to Grimmialp has no less than 1700 meters of positive altitude difference. Not sure if you're fit enough? No problem: by “just” climbing the Otterepass, hikers save themselves almost 400 meters of climbing and as many descents. The hike starts in Achseten. You quickly rise above the Entschlige valley, first on the road then on a partly forest path. At the Otternalp, it is time to leave the last traces of civilization and continue to climb into an increasingly wild landscape. When crossing the Otterepass, a glance upwards towards the Männliflue is enough to make your decision: to climb further, on a small steep path – and slippery in rainy weather – to conquer the summit, or to attack the summit directly. descent towards the Mittelberg mountain pasture. The only downside? The last part of the route towards Grimmialp gives pride of place to hard surfaces. Enough to finish legs already well put to work.
Distance: 19.01km
Elevation: 1718m

Title: LODGE ON THE LOWER GRINDELWALD GLACIER
Description: In 2005, a moraine broke out below the Stieregg hut in Grindelwald. A large part of the Alpine plateau slid onto the lower Grindelwald glacier and the inn had to be abandoned, which was located at the very edge of the ridge. As the masses of ice that supported them melted and the permafrost thawed, the steep mountain sides lost their stability, causing entire chunks of land to slide. It's hard to imagine that this rugged valley was still filled with glacier ice a few decades ago. At Pfingstegg, where the hike starts, no trace of the tragedy is yet visible. At every turn, the Fiescherhörner become more and more imposing. Around 1600 meters, the path follows a new route, created after the events of 2005. Previously, it continued gently towards the Stieregg hut, but now it climbs to the new Bäregg inn, which lies on stable rocky ground. From the welcoming sunny terrace, you can see the break in the slope down. If you look carefully, you can see the remains of the foundation walls of the Stieregg hut on the ridge. The tempting “Bäregg” map and the view invite you to take a break before the descent.
The Pfingstegg is reached by cable car from Grindelwald. The local bus runs from the station to the lower station.
Distance: 5.45km
Elevation: 483m

Title: HIGH ALTITUDE TRAIL IN THE GANTRISCH REGION
Description: This hike in the Gantrisch natural park crosses a surface known as windthrow, an area of ​​uprooted trees, caused by Hurricane Lothar in 1999. The hiking path runs along a ridge from which you can see, on the west side, the Plateau, the Schwarzenburgerland and the Jura and, on the east side, the Gantrisch chain and the 4000 Bernese. After Schwarzenbühl, the route leads to the southern slope of the Gägger via the wooden footbridge of the same name. It crosses a windthrow surface, sometimes several meters high, near fallen trees and stumps. Shortly after the devastating storm, there was an impenetrable mess of uprooted and broken spruce trees. Since then, small trees have grown back between the dead wood and the surface of the windthrow is full of life. Signs clarify that dead wood and “mess” are important for biodiversity because they provide habitat for insects, birds and mammals. The growing forest consists of more deciduous trees. It is more diverse than the original spruce forest, uniform, and will better withstand future storms. Once the Pfyffe has been crossed, the descent towards Zollhaus begins. Shortly before this place, we cross the border between the cantons of Bern and Fribourg.
You can reach “Gurnigel, Berghaus” by bus from Thurnen, which you can reach by train from Bern or Thun. Return by bus from Zollhaus (FR).
Distance: 15.96km
Elevation: 505m

Title: PICTURAL HIKE ON THE EDGE OF LAKE THUN
Description: 70 years ago, a monument to the Swiss painter Ferdinand Hodler was erected on the Finel in honor of the 100th anniversary of his birth. It was here that he created the first painting in his series on Lake Thun. For much longer, almost 300 years, an imposing lime tree has also stood here. Its only competition is the breathtaking view of the sunset, a particularly intense experience. The hike to reach this breathtaking place has some wonders in store. The only notable climb is visible after 500 meters. From Mülenen, the path crosses the Suldgraben mountain pasture and climbs through the woods towards Aeschiried. After a good hour, the view opens up over the Frutigtal valley, the dark blue lake and the surrounding mountain range and hills. The Lake Thun panoramic path now leads towards Därligen in a picturesque landscape. Along the way, pleasant grilling areas invite you to relax. Shortly before leaving Meielisalp, the Spissibach can be crossed without any problem thanks to spectacular suspension bridges. The goal of the hike is finally visible after a gentle climb through meadows and forest.
Mülenen is reached by train from Bern. The bus takes you to Interlaken or Spiez from Därligen.
Distance: 13.27km
Elevation: 554m

Title: FROM THE CANTON OF BERNE TO VALAIS ON FOOT
Description: The Gasteretal is an enchanting valley located near Kandersteg, isolated but still easy to access. A small bus leads from the station to Selden, the starting point of the hike. After crossing the suspension bridge, the steep path zigzags up through the forest. The hiker then reaches the Gfelalp mountain pasture. Just behind, the high plateau invites you to take a first break while offering an exceptional view of the upper Gasteretal valley. Invigorated, the hiker follows the path along the Lötschegletscher glacier. The snowfields persisting all year round are well marked and easy to navigate. Then comes the most difficult part of the climb, which goes through a rocky steep path. The path is certainly clearly marked and well secured by chains, but it is still better not to be afraid of heights. The Lötschenpass hut appears shortly afterwards. Chickens roam freely, while wooden trolls watch over the cabin. Here, the hiker can eat and sleep peacefully. The next day, he began the descent well rested. The view of the Bietschhorn is spectacular. Soon the zigzag path gets steeper and steeper and the elevation gain increases rapidly. The landscape changes from rocky alpine to green, and the first friendly cows are not long in coming. It is possible to eat at the Kummenalp inn, while enjoying the panorama. The path then evolves largely into the forest and follows a lovely stream. We soon arrive at our destination: the typically Valais village of Ferden, with its many traditional chalets.
INFORMATION
Selden is reached by bus, departing from Kandersteg.
Distance: 12.52km
Elevation: 1203m

Title: ON VIA BERNA
Description: In the postbus which goes up into the deep Gäntel valley (Gental), we already suspect that the journey on foot will also be interesting. The starting point is the Engstlenalp, where there is a picturesque lake and an imposing hotel. The hike continues towards the Tannalp, on the new Via Berna long-distance trail which, here, merges with the Via Alpina. We had barely left when the anticipated pleasure was confirmed. Already during the first hour, the views are incredible, lower down, on the Gental and, on the other side, on the Gauli glacial region. Everything is very well secured, but the passage is sometimes narrow when mountain bikers come from the opposite direction. At Tannalp, a brief meeting with the leisure society, who prefer to be driven rather than walked. A small train even runs on the section of asphalt road that runs towards the Tannensee from the Melchsee-Frutt mountain station. What a pleasure to turn off on the quiet path leading to Balmeregghoren and concentrate on your own steps. The path, which is narrower, does not present any difficulty, except for people prone to vertigo who may worry about crossing the ridge. But then, what a reward! The view opens onto the horizon over the Oberhasli mountains. The winter tourism infrastructure is clearly visible on the route, but the appearance of the Alpentower panoramic restaurant in the distance also provides a little relief after the many steep climbs. From Planplatten to Hasliberg, a descent of 1200 meters awaits walkers, but the path is pleasant and never too steep.
You can reach the Engstlenalp by taking the Alpentaxi from Meiringen
Distance: 18.21km
Elevation: 732m

Title: LAUTERBRUNNEN VALLEY
Description: This two-day hike will appeal to those who like to look back and see what they have accomplished. Gimmelwald, on the first day, and the Hotel Obersteinberg, on the second day, are almost always visible. But the view is not to be outdone, with the Schilthorn and the peaks surrounding the Schmadri glacial cirque. After the cable car ride to Gimmelwald, follow the natural road into the Sefinental, cross the bridge and climb a steep slope into the Busenwald. The path is technically easy, but physically demanding. At the edge of the forest, the climb is complete. It is possible to go further to Tanzbödeli to enjoy a fantastic view. We then pass by a steep rock wall where you should not suffer from vertigo. We soon see the Obersteinberg Hotel below. There is no electricity, the meal is done in the romantic light of candles. On the second day, walkers enter the valley, pass large rocks, pass through meadows and follow the Tschingel-Litschina stream. Here is the small Oberhore lake, then the wide bed of the Chrummbach stream. You can stop at both places before reaching the Oberhore moraine and then the proglacial margin of the Breithorn glacier, which has retreated a lot and whose gate is far behind. If you go there, watch out for falling rocks on the edges. It remains to choose whether you still want to go up to the small, unguarded Schmadri hut or go down the long way back, first pleasantly then increasingly steeply, over 1200 meters.
Gimmelwald is reached by the Stechelberg cable car (Schilthornbahn). The lower station and the “Stechelberg, Hotel” stop are reached by bus from Lauterbrunnen, from where the train travels to Interlaken Ost.
Distance: 20.35km
Elevation: 1329m

Title: THE HASLIBERG IN ANOTHER LIGHT
Description: It’s one of those family hikes that doesn’t give children a chance to get bored. It is pleasantly short and almost entirely downhill, so even the little ones can navigate it without any problems. Then, several highlights make children's hearts beat faster, far from all the Hasliberg theme trails which are overflowing with people, especially during the beautiful summer weekends. A decent family hike involves a cable car ride. The cable car starts from Reuti and reaches the intermediate station of Bidmi, where you pass the small lake of Bidmi. After crossing a flowery meadow offering a beautiful view of the valley, we arrive above Wasserwendi in a small steep forest with a few large erratic blocks which immediately make children want to climb and jump. The route continues along rural paths and several times passes streams so small that children will surely jump across them. After a short but steep descent, we reach a small lake near Twing, ideal for cooling off on hot summer days. The newts and young frogs that swim there can only please little explorers. Once you have had enough rest, you continue on a pleasantly flat route to Biitiflüö, where a protected grill site with benches and surrounded by numerous climbing stones invites you to take a long break. The steep descent to the Hasliberg Clinic once again passes fascinating rock formations and a small lake.
“Bidmi, Mägisalp” is reached by cable car from “Hasliberg Reuti” (Bidmi valley station). It can be reached by bus from “Brünig-Hasliberg” or by the large Meiringen cable car. From the “Hasliberg Hohfluh, Privatklinik” stop, a bus runs to Brünig.
Distance: 4.36km
Elevation: 46m

Title: COWS, WATERFALLS AND MEADOWS
Description: Every year, around 500 cows hike from Adelboden to Engstligenalp. Of course, they don't do it for the love of hiking, but for the fresh herbs that await them at the summit. Interested hikers can climb the 600 meters of altitude difference in the company of the cattle, under their own responsibility. Seeing these imposing beasts nimbly overcome this path cut into the rock, step by step, is an impressive experience. Several avoidance places allow you to observe and photograph the procession of cows who master the hairpin turns with flying colors. From the path, you can also see the Frutigtal in the morning light and the two Entschligefäll waterfalls. But the path is equally attractive every other day of the year. The hike is demanding, but when you walk without having to follow the pace of the herd, you can take your time. The path is steep and shaded. As it is designed for cows, it is wide and easily passable, but it is better not to be prone to vertigo. About halfway there, a narrow mountain hiking trail turns right and leads directly to the upper waterfall. Crossing the small bridge, you feel the force of the water on your skin. We finally reach the Engstligenalp plateau. There, the cowherds let the animals roam. Because each cow knows exactly which chalet it belongs to. And of course also where the juiciest herbs grow.
INFORMATION
The “Unter dem Birg” valley station is reached by bus from Frutigen and “Adelboden, Oey”.

Title: THE EXPOSED RIDGE OF HARDERGRAT
Description: Departing from Interlaken, the Harder funicular and its average slope of 64% allows its passengers to gain 570 meters in altitude in ten minutes. Arriving at the top station, we start directly with the walk on the ridge. The Hardergrat is still worth it: it takes four hours of walking and above all, this exposed mountain hike is not suitable for people with fear of heights, be careful. On the other hand, it offers an incredible view overlooking Lakes Brienz and Thun. When visibility is good, you can even admire the famous three peaks of Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau. If you are lucky, you will also be able to observe ibexes in this place. The Lombachalp landscape is one of the largest bog landscapes in Switzerland. It is part of the federal inventory of landscapes and natural monuments of national importance (BLN), the federal free district of Augstmatthorn, as well as the cantonal nature reserve Hohgant-Seefeld. So it’s no surprise that this hike is on any hiker’s bucket list. Ryan Regez, the multiple skicross world champion, is a true enthusiast of this hike, he no longer needs to be convinced. Even though he is used to it, he did not hesitate for a single second to accompany us during the filming of this video for this hiking proposal. In the video of this hiking suggestion, he talks about how he finds his place and his peace while hiking, but also how he must prove his strength. Those who wish can still make the descent to the Lombachalp with a detour via the Augstmatthorn.
Harder Kulm can be reached with the Harderbahn from Interlaken. From Lombachalp, the post bus takes you back to Habkern.
Distance: 11.16km
Elevation: 1089m

Title: ALUVIAL LANDSCAPE IN THE ENTSCHLIGETAL
Description: It is surprising to discover a wild place half an hour from Frutigen. If the water level of the Entschlige River is low, you can have fun splashing around in its wide bed with children. Halfway, the river is crossed on one of the longest suspension bridges in Europe. The hike starts at Frutigen station. Marked by the sign “Holzskulpturenweg”, it goes up the Entschlige. Outside the village, here are already the wooden sculptures of the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood. On the edge of the “Engstligenauen” nature reserve, the Ghent grill site has a large fire pit. Through beautiful green meadows and pastures and sparse forests, walkers cross an alluvial region to the Hostalde suspension bridge. A steep but brief staircase leads to the bridge. From up there, the view rewards the efforts. After a stop at the refreshment bar, hikers pass through meadows and sparse beech forests above the Entschlige to reach Frutigen. Sculptures of foxes and bears adorn the path. Here and there, we see the stream between the trees. The last section, on asphalt, crosses hamlets to Frutigen.
Frutigen can be reached by train from Bern or Spiez. You can reach the Hostalde suspension bridge with bus line 230 Frutigen Kandersteg, “Hohstalden” stop. People who do not stop at the refreshment bar are asked to make a donation for the maintenance of the bridge.
Distance: 9.56km
Elevation: 247m

Title: BOLTIGEN CIRCUIT TO LAKE WALOPSEE (BE)
Description: Lovers of mountain lakes sheltered from the hordes of tourists will be happy on the Walop mountain pasture. Surrounded by pastures, Lake Walopsee is located in the heart of an enchanting high valley. Devoid of tributaries, it measures approximately 300 meters by 200 and often takes on an intense color in autumn. The mountain pasture is also home to the Ranggiloch cave, where traces of Stone Age civilization have been found. In summer, many herds graze there (be careful, they are often guarded by dogs). The circuit, made for experienced walkers, begins in Reidenbach, near Boltigen. The first section follows an asphalt road. In just over an hour you reach the Chlus basin, where you have to climb the first serious slope along the Rockschwarteflue hill. After climbing 500 meters on a stony path, you are rewarded with a fantastic view of the Walopsee. We then follow the lake and then reach the Vordere Walop junction, where a new 400 meters of elevation await the walker. This climb to Garte via Luchere allows you to enjoy, at more than 2000 meters above sea level, a fantastic view of the Bernese Alps. To the southeast, you can even see Mont Blanc. From here, the route only goes back down. You have to turn left near Rohrbode and Rieneschli before taking a pretty path through meadows and woods then going down a steep slope to Chlus. The last hour, a little arduous, takes the same route to Reidenbach, including the last section on the road. However, with a head full of heavenly images, we manage to swallow it without difficulty.
Reidenbach can be reached by bus from Boltigen station.
Distance: 16.38km
Elevation: 1280m

Title: THE RETURN OF THE HERD TO RIFFENMATT
Description: On the first Thursday in September, you have to get up early to see the sheep trotting between the stands of the Riffenmatt market. At 8 o'clock, the ringing of the bells resonates louder and louder as the shepherd appears with his flock. Late risers will also find what they are looking for here because the market, which is still aimed at farmers, has remained authentic. There are many things there whose names the inhabitants of the plain often do not know. After the market visit, a short scenic hike passes the Guggershorn and ends in Schwarzenburg. In the center of the village of Riffenmatt, a sign indicates to the left the path marked as a local tour towards Guggisberg. In this village, cross the main street and turn off onto the Alpine panoramic path, not without making a detour to the Vreneli museum (open by appointment). The trail climbs steeply through pastures and a small forest before a flight of steps over bare pudding joins the Guggershorn. From here, the panorama extends from the Friborg Alps to Bern, passing through the western part of the Plateau. The descent through the forest is initially steep to Wahlenhaus, where Hans-Joggeli, Vreneli's unfortunate lover, is said to have lived. Then the route becomes less steep, passing through meadows and near farms towards the place called Dorfmatte. The path over the Schildbergli hills is very pleasant. On the other hand, at Dorfmatte, walkers unfortunately have to cover two kilometers on asphalt. Then, the path turns left into the forest and passes near a molasse quarry. As soon as you leave the woods, you enjoy a beautiful view of Schwarzenburg, the destination of the hike.
Riffenmatt is reached by post bus from Schwarzenburg, which the train serves from Bern.
Distance: 10.03km
Elevation: 264m

Title: FROM THE IFFIG ALPAGE TO THE SIMME FALLS
Description: At the start, on the Iffig alpine pasture, a brief return on the road is necessary to join the mountain path which rises towards Alp Ritz, where an award-winning alpine cheese is on sale. The Langermatte high plateau is quickly reached. From here, a short detour via a fairly steep climb on a ridge provides access to the summit of Oberlaubhorn. It is possible to continue to the flat area below, decorated with a cross. It is in this region that a women's battle, the "Wyberschlacht", is said to have taken place during the Reformation era when the men of La Lenk were off to war. The path leading to the Col du Rawyl, in Valais, formerly passed through Langermatte. According to legend, the Valaisans had stolen cattle there to take them home, but boys from La Lenk repatriated the animals at night, during a secret operation. The angry Valaisans crossed the Rawyl again but the women armed with pitchforks and scythes were waiting for them on the Langermatte plateau and put them to flight. Return to Langermatte: the path crosses a larch forest which is more reminiscent of Valais, towards the fascinating Sept Fontaines. Melt water from the Rezli and Plaine Morte glaciers seeps into the subsoil and gushes out of seven cracks dug in the karst rock. Throughout the descent, several waterfalls appear along the way, with pride of place going to the Simme Falls near Barbara Bridge, where the water droplets are sure to be refreshing. To reach the goal of the hike, walk along the road or along the Simme on a narrow path that is a little bumpy and slippery in wet weather.
You can reach the Iffig mountain pasture (Ifffigenalp) by post bus from La Lenk station. From the “Lenk, Simmenfälle” stop, the postbus travels in the opposite direction.
Distance: 10.77km
Elevation: 546m

Title: ABOVE LAKE THUN
Description: Until the end of the 19th century, Switzerland was largely equipped with a sophisticated warning system. Placed on peaks visible in the distance, watchtowers (“signals”, or “Chutzen” among the Alemannics) were used to quickly alert the population with fires or smoke signals. Old Bern had more than 150 between the Rhine and Lake Geneva. The Blueme tower was part of this and transmitted alerts, for example, to the Bantiger tower, located 30 kilometers away, not far from Bern. At the time, these heights accommodated pastures and were therefore not forested. Today, the tower built in 1984 barely rises above the treetops and offers a panoramic view of the Bernese Alps. The hike begins in Tschingel, a small sunny village on the heights of Lake Thun. The path is easy to find: just follow the signs towards Blueme. Very steep, the first section crosses pastures and flowering meadows in a straight line to reach Margel. After this effort, hikers can take a short break on the bench and enjoy the view of Lake Thun and the Bernese peaks. After Tschingelallmi, we continue on a rocky path to cross a splendid forest. Tall spruce trees rise above a bright green bed of blueberry bushes, and the path is punctuated by moss-covered stumps. Thus, the last meters of altitude difference are achieved without difficulty. At the foot of the panoramic tower, perfectly equipped areas await grill lovers. On the way down, the route first follows a forest path, then a steep path strewn with roots towards Wolfgruebe. We then follow the forest road for around ten minutes, before taking the stairs leading to the Heiligenschwendi rehabilitation center.
The “Tschingel ob Gunten, Dorf” stop can be reached by bus from Thun, changing in Oberhofen or Sigriswil. A bus in the direction of Thun passes every half hour at the “Heiligenschwendi, Reha Zentrum” stop.
Self-service restaurant “malZeit” (open daily) in the Heiligenschwendi rehabilitation center.

Title: TRAGEDIES AND TRIUMPHS AT EIGER
Description: The weather conditions were anything but favorable when, in 1952, rescuers set out to respond to a call for help, risking their lives. An American military plane had just crashed on the Guggi glacier. 50 years later, the glacier returned the debris of the wreck. Every spring, snow from avalanches carried them to the hiking trail. Although there is no longer any trace of this disaster today, the view of the glacier constantly reminds hikers of the tragedy. The imposing masses of rock and ice of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau seem within reach when you get off the train at Wengernalp. First on the flat, the path crosses flowering meadows to a small wood where it crosses the Nesselbach. It then rises east to Haaregg, below the ski lifts. A stop is necessary before tackling the very steep slope. We can imagine the suffering of the participants in the Jungfrau Marathon who, every year in September, struggle to reach the summit at an altitude of 2,100 meters, passing through the moraine. After a good hour and a half of walking, we reach the highest point of the hike at the Eigergletscher station. Along the path which takes us to the Little Scheidegg in 40 minutes, wooden steles retrace the eventful history of the north wall of the Eiger, the first conquest of which dates back to 1938. The names of all those who conquered the mythical wall are engraved in stone along the way, without forgetting those of the more than 60 climbers who lost their lives there. Triumphs and tragedies coexist here in the Jungfrau region.
Wengernalp is reached by train from Lauterbrunnen.
Distance: 5.82km
Elevation: 502m

Title: AROUND LAKE THUN
Description: Of the six suspension bridges planned for the day along the panoramic route around Lake Thun, three are already in place. The one which was first inaugurated in December 2011 passes over the Spissibach river near Leissigen. In October 2012, it was the turn of the Sigriswil bridge to be put into service. The latter is the goal of the hike which begins near Oberhofen. From the start, this easy route offers a first point of interest which rewards the efforts of the climb from Oberhofen to the Balmflue. The path passes through a cool, lush forest, first alongside a huge rock, then between large blocks of pudding. Hollow gullies, overhanging rocks and large rock formations line the path. We soon reach the Riderbach. This river still needs to be crossed by its bed, but there are plans to build a suspension bridge there. The hillside path continues towards Blooch. A grill area invites you to take a break. The path continues through the forest which constantly offers a glimpse of a beautiful panorama. A little before Erizbüel, the hiker leaves the shaded coolness of the trees. It soon reaches Aeschlen and the new suspension bridge that leads to Sigriswil. With its 340 meters long and 180 meters high, it is the largest suspended structure on the panoramic path. It is not only used by hikers, but also by the children of Aeschlen who use it to go to school.
The construction of the suspension bridge having been financed by a private association, without public money, an amount of 8 francs is requested per crossing. Access is free for children under 16 years old.
Distance: 7.39km

Title: SAANENLAND SEEN FROM ABOVE
Description: “Wispile” are found by the dozen in the Pays de Gessenay (Saanenland). The localities bearing this name are all located on the rocky ridge which extends between Gsteig and Gstaad, further north. The best known is Höji Wispile; a gondola leaves from Gstaad Grund and goes up to the panoramic heights. Its name, which means “High Wispile”, is however confusing, because the Walliser Wispile, further south, surpasses it by a good forty meters with its 1983 meters. There is also the Hinderi Wispile and the Vorderi Wispile above Gsteig. The strange toponym “Wispile” has neither to do with wine (“Wein”) nor with a wind chime (“Windspiel”). It is a term of Celtic origin which meant “meadow”. And indeed there are large pastures on the long ridge that connects the Saanental and the Louwenetal. As the relief is relatively gentle, these regions have always been easy to cultivate. The area is also ideal for mountain hiking, as it offers splendid panoramic views. The route from Gsteig to Lake Lauenen (Louwenesee) via the Walliser Wispile, for example, is rich in diversity. We start with a rather steep climb along the Burgfälle waterfalls and through a fir forest; we continue through less steep meadows to Vorderi Wispile, then to Walliser Wispile. The second part is a magnificent high altitude hike towards Chrine and passing through Hinderi Wispile. We turn completely east just before the small pass. A wide gravel path then leads to Lake Lauenen in large loops.
Gsteig is reached by bus from Saanen, Gstaad and Les Diablerets; the return is by bus from “Lauenensee” to Gstaad
Distance: 13.34km
Elevation: 843m

Title: LAKE SEEBERG, THE PEARL OF DIEMTIGTAL
Description: Two hunters chat in front of the Seeberg restaurant. One says he saw more than 100 ibexes near Alpetli. The other says he counted exactly 116 chamois heading towards Wiriehore. They lean against the wall of the house and drink their “Chüjerkafi” topped with cream. From Zwischenflüh, we went up to Meniggrund, passing in particular on a small concrete road. The discovery trail through the forest is strewn with large pieces of gnarled wood and broken branches. There we see centuries-old aroles and, at the foot of a sycamore maple, the rare lichen lobaria pulmonaria. Since the passage of Hurricane Lothar in 1999, the site has been untouched. Suddenly Lake Seeberg appears behind a rounded hill, which seems protected by high rocks at one of its ends. Clouds and peaks are reflected on the surface of the water in which a mother and her little daughter are dipping their feet. The lake, located in the Spillgerten reserve, is in its natural state. Before the descent, a detour to the Seeberg restaurant and its mountain pasture operated all summer is essential. On our plate, an alpine cheese, “Mutschli”, rebibes and goat cheese. Here, we also make certified alpine cheese sold in supermarkets in the Bern region. The steak comes from one of the pigs in the neighboring pigsty, where the animals are fed with whey from the cheese factory. After a brief climb towards a mountain, the Stand, the steep descent begins on a narrow winding path. The markings are red-white-red and we are happy to have good hiking shoes. From this very picturesque path, you can see, on the right, the Schwenden mountain pasture, surrounded by an imposing rock wall. Meter by meter, we reach the Diemtigtal.
“Zwischenflüh, Anger” and “Schwenden i.D., Fildrichbrücke” can be reached by post bus from Oey-Diemtigen, located on the Spiez–Zweisimmen railway line.
